# 📚 Doubly Linked List in Java (From Scratch)
##  📌 Overview

This project implements a Doubly Linked List in Java from scratch as part of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) practice.
The implementation focuses on understanding pointer manipulation using prev and next references without relying on built-in libraries.

## ✨ Features Implemented

➕ Add First – Insert a node at the beginning

➕ Add Last – Insert a node at the end

➖ Remove First – Delete the first node

➖ Remove Last – Delete the last node

🔁 Reverse List – Reverse the entire linked list

📄 Display List – Traverse and print elements

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

Doubly Linked List structure

Node traversal (forward & backward)

Pointer updates (prev & next)

Edge case handling (empty list, single node)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Language: Java

Concept: Data Structures (Linked List)

## ▶️ How to Run

Clone the repository

Compile the Java file:

javac DoublyLinkedList.java


Run the program:

java DoublyLinkedList

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is created for DSA revision and hands-on learning, helping to build a strong foundation in linked list operations and problem-solving skills.

## 📌 Future Enhancements

Search operation

Insert at specific position

Delete by value
